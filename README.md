# Anki Story Generator

Generates stories in a foreign language to help users better memorize the words in foreign language they recently learned in Anki.
Story generation is powered by ChatGPT.

This project is a proof-of-concept to check if such project works reasonably well, and to help me see if:

- The generated stories are fun to read and something I would like to use myself?
- Such additional form of review improves memory encoding or retrieval and allows to learn words more effectively?
- Such idea can work well with relatively unstructured decks (e.g. fields containing my comments in mixed languages)?
